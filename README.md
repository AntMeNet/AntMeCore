##AntMe!

AntMe! is a free, fun game that teaches players object-oriented programming. It’s easy to pick up, it’s exciting, and despite being a game, it’s very relevant to real-world applications. You control your very own ant colony using real, professional code. You teach your ants how to master many challenges, like how to gather sugar and apples, how to defend their anthill and how to defeat the natural enemies of ants and programmers alike: bugs. From the very start, AntMe! teaches you how to code using a real programming language (C# and Visual Basic are currently supported). That means that you can immediately utilize your new knowledge to write working programs of your own. The game is based on a sound scientific foundation and is currently used with considerable success in a number of schools and universities.
